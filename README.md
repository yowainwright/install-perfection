_**Install dependencies with control, perfectly ðŸ’–**_

Sometimes, you need nuance and control over your npm dependencies. You might want to minimize your `node_module` folder size when shipping to production. Or, you might want to switch dependencies on the fly. For this, **Install Perfection** might be the tool you need.

---

## How easy is Install Perfection to set up?

Very easy. If not, submit an issue!

You can use Install Perfection as a CLI only.
```bash

```

If you'd like to use it a bit more explicitly, you can configure it to read an `.installrc` config file, or as an object within your `package.json`.

```ts

```

If you'd like to build something custom, you can copy it's functionality into your own project or you can use the exported functions directlyâ€”as they're typed and tested.

```ts

```

## Is name, Install Perfection, a bit much?

Yes. Just like your _node_module_ folder. Use Install Perfect to make it a bit better.
