_**Install dependencies with control, perfectly ðŸ’–**_

Sometimes, you need nuance and control over your npm dependencies. You might want to minimize your `node_module` folder size when shipping to production. Or, you might want to switch dependencies on the fly. For this, **Install Perfection** might be the tool you need.

## How easy is Install Perfection to set up?

Very easy. If not, [submit an issue](https://github.com/yowainwright/install-perfection/issues)!

You can use Install Perfection as a CLI only.
```bash
npx install-perfection --include '{"playwright-core": "latest"}' --ignore '{"playwright": "latest"}'
```

If you'd like to use it a bit more explicitly, you can configure it to read an `.installrc` config file, or as an object within your `package.json`.

```ts
// .installrc
{
  "include": {
    "playwright-core": "latest"
  },
  "ignore": {
    "playwright": "latest"
  }
}
```

If you'd like to build something custom, you can copy it's functionality into your own project or you can use the exported functions directlyâ€”as they're typed and tested.

```ts
import { install } from 'install-perfection'

install({
  include: {
    'playwright-core': 'latest'
  },
  ignore: {
    'playwright': 'latest'
  },
})
```
