_**Install dependencies with control, (perfection) ðŸ’–**_

Sometimes, you need nuance and control over your npm dependencies.

> You might want to minimize your `node_module` folder size when shipping to production. Or, you might want to switch dependencies on the fly. For this, **Install Perfection** might be the tool you need.

---

## How easy is Install Perfection to set up?

Very easy. If not, [submit an issue](https://github.com/yowainwright/install-perfection/issues)!

You can use Install Perfection as a CLI only.
```bash
npx install-perfection --include {"playwright-core": "latest"} --ignore {"playwright": "latest"}
```

If you'd like to use it a bit more explicitly, you can configure it in your `package.json`.

```ts
// package.json
{
  ...
  "install": {
    "include": {
      "playwright-core": "latest"
    },
    "ignore": {
      "playwright": "latest"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

Or, if you like to keep your `package.json` pure, you can create a `.installrc` file with the same configuration.

```ts
// .installrc
{
  "include": {
    "playwright-core": "latest"
  },
  "ignore": {
    "playwright": "latest"
  }
}
```

If you'd like to build something custom, you can copy it's functionality into your own project or you can use the exported functions directlyâ€”as they're typed and tested.

```ts
import { install } from 'install-perfection'

install({
  include: {
    'playwright-core': 'latest'
  },
  ignore: {
    'playwright': 'latest'
  },
})
```

## How do I use Install Perfection?

Install Perfection is built to be used as a CLI first and foremost. It also exports node functions which can be used to preform the same install operation.

---

Install or reference Install Perfection in your project.

```bash
npm install install-perfection --save-dev
```

Or via a CDN (untested)

```
import { install } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/merge-tsconfigs@latest"
```

  },
  ignore: {
    'playwright': 'latest'
